# Cloud Data Warehouse Project

## Description
Sparkify, a musing streaming startup, has grown their user base and song database and would like to move their processes
and data onto the cloud. Their data, user activity and song metadata, resides in json files in S3.

The project's task is to build an ETL pipeline that extracts data from S3, stages the data in Redshift, and transforms
the data into a set of dimensional tables for the analytics team to further gain insights on their useres' behaviors.
